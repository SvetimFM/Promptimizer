I'm trying to write a "{target_of_action}" prompt.

My current prompt is:
"{prompt}"

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:
{error_string}

Furthermore, it may not be specific enough, and is written for people and not for [llm_name] inference

give {num_feedbacks} reasons why the prompt could have gotten these examples wrong, and what it might be lacking in
terms of semantics necessary for LLM inference.

Wrap each reason with <START> and <END>
