I'm trying to write a "{target_of_action}" prompt.

My current prompt is:
"{prompt}"

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:
{error_string}

it needs to perform best for large language model {llm_name} inference

give reasons why the prompt could have gotten these examples wrong, and what it might be lacking in
terms of semantics necessary for LLM inference.

Wrap each reason with <START> and <END>
