Based on the given prompt {prompt}, target of prompt's action {toa}, and error remaining in the prompt {semantic_error},
 output only (ONLY!) a float number between 0.0 to 1.0 denoting the prompts efficacy against the target of action within prompts domain

 0.0 is completely unable to reliably satisfy prompts requirements
 0.5 is sometimes capable, but many edge cases and issues remain
 1.0 is always able to produce desired outcome

 output format must be a single number between 0.0 and 1.0
