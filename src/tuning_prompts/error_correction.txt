I'm crafting a prompt focused on "{toa}".

Given the feedback, I recognize the need for greater specificity and alignment with the capabilities and processing
style of {llm_name}. To address the noted issue of {semantic_error}, I have revised my approach to ensure the prompt is
not only more targeted towards the desired outcome but also optimized for machine comprehension.

Revised prompt:

    Ensure the language is clear and direct, minimizing ambiguity.
    Introduce specific examples or context that aligns closely with "{toa}", providing a more solid foundation for
    {llm_name} to generate accurate and relevant responses.
    Adjust the wording to reflect a structure and format that {llm_name} is optimized to understand, focusing on
    concise and straightforward instructions.
    Incorporate feedback on the previous prompt's limitations, specifically {semantic_error}, by clarifying any vague
    terms and ensuring the intent is unmistakably aligned with "{toa}".

The aim is to refine the prompt to better serve its purpose, enhancing effectiveness without straying from the original
objective. Through this iterative refinement, the goal is to achieve a more precise and impactful interaction with
{llm_name}, facilitating a more accurate and useful response.

The new prompt is:
