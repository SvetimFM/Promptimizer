Given the prompt: '{prompt}', your task is to compress it into a shorter version that conveys the same information,
retains the original meaning, and produces the same output when processed by an LLM. The compressed version should be
syntactically correct, semantically identical to the original, and easily parsable by an LLM. Please ensure the
compression is significant but does not omit any critical details or alter the fundamental message.
Aim for clarity, brevity, and precision.
