Given the prompt: '{prompt}', and its intended Target of Action (ToA): '{toa}', generate a critique focusing exclusively on enhancements.
Your critique should identify and list areas for improvement that, when addressed, will refine the prompt's clarity, specificity, and alignment with the original prompt and the ToA.

Ensure your feedback:

    Maintains the original intent of the prompt, avoiding suggestions that diverge significantly from the initial objectives.
    Enhances the prompt's effectiveness in achieving its ToA without adding unnecessary complexity.
    Identifies any ambiguity, lack of specificity, or misalignment with the ToA, providing concrete examples and suggestions for improvement.
    Proposes adjustments that ensure the final prompt is more concise, clear, and directly aligned with the ToA, leading to better overall results.

Focus on generating a list of actionable improvements that adhere to these guidelines
