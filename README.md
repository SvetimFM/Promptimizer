# Promptimizer: Automatic Prompt Optimization Framework
#### Based on [Automatic Prompt Optimization with â€œGradient Descent" and Beam Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03495.pdf) paper.
#### Promptimizer is a framework designed to optimize textual prompts for interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). 


### Features:
    Synthetic Example generation: optimization will create synthetic examples against which the seed prompt is modified

    Optional Monte Carlo Expansion: Generates a diverse set of prompt expansions, including semantically identical but differently worded variations, to explore a broader space of potential improvements.

    Semantic Error Critique: Evaluates prompts based on their semantic alignment with a target action or objective, identifying specific areas for improvement.

    Error Correction: Offers direct methods for correcting identified semantic errors in prompts, ensuring targeted refinement towards the optimization goal.

    Coming: Domain-Specific Optimization: Categorizes the optimization task into well-understood domains (e.g., text generation, code generation, sentiment analysis) and applies domain-specific heuristics or strategies for more effective optimization.


### Usage

To use Promptimizer, users should define their initial prompt, target action, and, optionally (to be implemented), a set of example data to guide the optimization process. The framework then iterates through expansion, critique, correction, and selection phases to refine the initial prompt into an optimized version.


### Example usage
 
````
promptimizer = Promptimizer(llm=llm,
                            seed_prompt=input_prompt,
                            winner_count=count_of_winners,
                            example_data=None,
                            compress=compress_final_prompt,
                            image_gen=image_prompt_optimization,
                            synthetic_examples=generate_synthetic_examples)
                            
response = promptimizer.promptimize(expansion_factor=count_of_versions,
                                    steps_factor=count_of_generations)
