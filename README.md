# Promptimizer: Automatic Prompt Optimization Framework
#### Based on [Automatic Prompt Optimization with â€œGradient Descent" and Beam Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03495.pdf) paper.
#### Promptimizer is a framework designed to optimize textual prompts for interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). 


### Features:
    Synthetic Example generation: optimization will create synthetic examples against which the seed prompt is modified

    Optional Monte Carlo Expansion: Generates a diverse set of prompt expansions, including semantically identical but differently worded variations, to explore a broader space of potential improvements.

    Semantic Error Critique: Evaluates prompts based on their semantic alignment with a target action or objective, identifying specific areas for improvement.

    Error Correction: Offers direct methods for correcting identified semantic errors in prompts, ensuring targeted refinement towards the optimization goal.

    Coming: Domain-Specific Optimization: Categorizes the optimization task into well-understood domains (e.g., text generation, code generation, sentiment analysis) and applies domain-specific heuristics or strategies for more effective optimization.


### Usage

To use Promptimizer, users should define their initial prompt, target action, and, optionally, a set of example data to guide the optimization process. The framework then iterates through expansion, critique, correction, and selection phases to refine the initial prompt into an optimized version.


### Example usage
 
````
optimized_prompts = run_optimizer( 
llm,
seed_prompt="Your initial prompt here",
target_of_action="Your target action or error function to minimize",
expansion_factor=10,
winner_count=1,
example_data={"Your example data": "Here"}
)
````


### Installation

Promptimizer is designed to be integrated with existing LLM frameworks and APIs. Details on installation and dependencies will be provided in subsequent releases.
